# Project description
My project is a program for Dota 2 players. You can quickly learn to play or improve your level of play.
The app provides a description of each of the heroes, their characteristics, game tactics, and the most suitable items for purchase. This program is a collection of guides for each hero, collected from various sources. It is also possible to use a “picker” to determine at the stage of choosing heroes which hero to ban, which one to pick. All information on heroes and items will be stored in a relational database.
